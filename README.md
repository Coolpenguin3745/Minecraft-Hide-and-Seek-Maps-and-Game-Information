# Minecraft-Hide-and-Seek-Maps-and-Game-Information

A community project repository to add and have a bunch of Minecraft Hide and Seek maps for the Bedrock Edition, so that everyone can easily get access to all the maps. The maps are all up to date, with the appropriate texture pack and no name tags. I want this project to be where people can add maps that they have, so everyone can have access to them. So if you have any maps, please share. I will have a video down below on how to add files to this project:

Video will be posted soon

# Rules and how to play Hide and Seek

### How to play Hide and Seek

Each player goes through the Randomizer, getting a wool block. If you get Hider, your job is to hide in the map and not get caught. If you get Seeker, your job is to catch all the Hiders by lighting them on fire. Once caught, they put on a chest plate or notify that they have been caught and become a Seeker themselves. The game ends once everyone is caught.


### Rules

Rules:

1. Gamertags off

2. As a hider, once you get caught by a seeker, you help the seeker catch more hiders.

3. Everyone needs to be caught for the round to end.

# Roles

## Hider:

As the hider, your goal is to hide in the map and not get caught.

## Seeker:

As the seeker, your goal is to catch all the Hiders by lighting them on fire and have them join your team.
